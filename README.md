# ps-angular-front-to-back-with-web-api

Following along with Deborah Kurata's Pluralsight course "Angular Front to Back with Web API".

At this point, all we've done is create a Web API project **("APM.WebApi") in a solution called "APM"**.

We've also added an **ASP.NET Empty Website Project ("APM.Client") to the "APM" solution.**

The latter project will house our client application:
HTML
JavaScript (mainly AngularJS)
CSS

The initial contents of the client web app is straight from Deborah's GitHub repo "AngularF2BWebAPI" (https://github.com/DeborahK/AngularF2BWebAPI).

Version of the web app that I've included is as latest commit in Deborah's repo as at 11/05/2015, minus 2 files:

* ProductListCtrl.js
* ProductListView.html
